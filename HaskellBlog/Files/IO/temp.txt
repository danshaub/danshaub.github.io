Hello Dan, how are you?
Wonderful weather we're having!

What'd the doctor say?

Nothing. Supposedly
it's just a 24-hour bug.
He gave me some pills.

I told you
you probably just
ate some bad gristle.

Should we take
the short cut
or the scenic route?

Let's take
the short cut.

But the scenic route
is so much prettier.

Okay, let's take
the scenic route.



Great.

It's actually slightly
quicker anyway.

Thank you.

What is a squab?

You know what it is.
lt's like a pigeon
l suppose.

Should we go through
the hole under
the horse fence,

or climb the rail
over the bridle path?

The horse fence
is a little safer.

But the bridle path
puts us right next
to the squab shack.

Well, okay.

What's wrong?
You're acting skittish.

Don't worry. l've been
stealing birds for a living
since before l could trot.

You look unbelievably
beautiful tonight.
You're practically glowing.

Maybe it's
the lighting.

Come on.
